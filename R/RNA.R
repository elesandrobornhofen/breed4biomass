#' Gene expression data via RNA sequencing
#'
#' A dataset containing gene expression data for 4,767 genes. Reads were mapped to the 
#' *Lolium perenne* reference genome (Nagy et al., 2022). The expression matrix in normalized read count 
#' values in fragments per kilobase of transcript per million (FPKM) was filtered by expression
#' median, variance, and read counts across samples. Finally, a pseudo count was added and the log base 2
#' calculated $$[log_2(x+1)]$$. There are 144 samples, which consists of 79 F2 families 
#' of hybrid ryegrass (samples b001 to b079) and 65 F2 families of \emph{Festulolium loliaceum}
#' (samples b086 to b150).
