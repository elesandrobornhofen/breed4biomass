\description{
A data set containing gene expression data for 4,767 genes. Reads were mapped to the
\emph{Lolium perenne} reference genome (Nagy et al., 2022). The expression matrix in normalized read count
values in fragments per kilobase of transcript per million (FPKM) was filtered by expression
median, variance, and read counts across samples. Finally, a pseudo count was added and the log base 2
was calculated \eqn{[log_2(x+1)]}. There are 144 samples, which consist of 79 F2 families
of hybrid ryegrass (samples b001 to b079) and 65 F2 families of \emph{Festulolium loliaceum}
(samples b086 to b150). The user is referred to the source link below for further information on
data acquisition and processing.
