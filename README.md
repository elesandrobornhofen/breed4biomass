Breed for Biomass project (grant 6150-00020B, Innovation Fund Denmark) readily available to the scientific community. The package contains data of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, RNA sequencing, and SNP-based genomic markers for 144  individuals. Samples are represented by family pools of hybrid ryegrass (79 entries) and 
*Festulolium loliaceum* (65 entries).
